# Numpy Networks

This project allows you to build and train simple neural networks. The network can include convolutional, max-pooling and 
fully-connected layers. These layers can be combined in any order, and will be trained using backpropogation. 

### Prerequisites

To run the code you need to have numpy, tensorflow and matplotlib. Though tensorflow is only used to get MNIST data.

```
sudo pip3 install numpy
sudo pip3 install matplotlib
sudo pip3 install tensorflow
```

## Running the code

* Examples of how to build networks are contained in graphs.py
* An example of how to train networks can be seen in train_graphs.py 
* To train a predefined networks edit main.py before running
* To run the predefined and trained graphs edit main.py before running
